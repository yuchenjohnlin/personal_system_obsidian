# **Who actually creates “requirements” in a software company?**

There are **3 major sources**, and each behaves differently:

### **1️⃣ Users (customers, clients, internal users) → provide “needs”**


What they provide is usually _not_ a requirement.

It’s more like:

- “This workflow is too slow.”
    
- “I wish I could export the data.”
    
- “This UI is confusing.”
    
- “I need more analytics when debugging.”
    

These are **problems**, **pain points**, and **desires**, not requirements.

### **2️⃣ Leadership (CEO/CTO/VP) → provides “strategic goals”**

This is high-level direction such as:

- “We need AI features this year.”
    
- “Reduce infrastructure cost by 20%.”
    
- “Enter the European market.”
    
- “Improve new-user activation.”
    
Not specific features → more like **company priorities**.

CTOs also throw in _ideas_ like:

- “What if we used vector search for this?”
    
- “I think onboarding should be simpler.”
    
Again: **not requirements**, but inputs.

### **3️⃣ Product Managers → turn everything into actual requirements**

PMs are the ones who translate:

- user needs
    
- stakeholder ideas
    
- business goals
    
- technical constraints
    
→ into **actionable, unambiguous requirements**.

These requirements describe:

- **what problem is being solved**
    
- **what success looks like**
    
- **what features must exist**
    
- **what must not be included (non-goals)**
    
- **acceptance criteria**
    
- **expected user flows**
    
A PM’s job is **definition + alignment**, not to invent everything.

# **⭐️ So what do engineers do with those requirements?**

### **Engineers take PM requirements and turn them into:**

### **🔧 Technical solutions & implementation details**

Things like:

- APIs
    
- database schema
    
- system architecture
    
- data pipelines
    
- load handling
    
- time estimations
    
- risk analysis

Engineers decide _how_ to build it.

PMs decide _what_ to build and _why_.
