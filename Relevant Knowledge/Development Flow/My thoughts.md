Big / Small companies will have different design flows according to the scale
but I think the philosophy will not change that much.

Basically, you have a need. For me it is easy to translate the need into concrete ideas because I understand software myself. However, when you don't understand then there is a level of translation. This introduces the need to have someone to do this. PMs? I don't really like this word.
- Users, CTO will have thoughts about high level needs, on this level we could also separate this into different kinds of needs. From competitors, future, ...
- PMs have to turn these into concrete requirements for the engineers and specify why ?
- Engineers will do how it is done
Anyways, I want to emphasize on the fact that there are translations between tasks, which introduces different positions. 

In my case, I am the CTO, use, PM and the engineer.
It is a little hard for me to actually separate my thoughts and learning this helps me understand what I didn't know.
