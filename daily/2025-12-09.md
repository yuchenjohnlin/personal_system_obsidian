Yesterday, I completed a very simple create user and login interface. 
### TO DO
- Add Authentication to the login and user password
- define routes so that the frontend can correctly decide if the user is logged in.
- 

### Thoughts
Authentication is different for mobile and browsers, need more consideration here.

When designing the create user process, studies show that the best signup flow asks for the minimum possible information, usually email + password. 
A lot of the modern apps also don't require usernames anymore because email itself is a unique identifier, unless it has a public profile requires. 
The strictness of the password requirement also materss. password length is more important than complexity, and a minimum of 8 characters + strong hashing is enough.

What if we need the user's name to do any notification ? Then we add them in the profile part afterwards. 

because our app is more of a personal app, so we won't add this yet.
