### TO DO
1. Refactor purchase code
	1. Autosave Hook - each field from backend doesn't need multiple useEffects
	2. InlineEdit Component - use autosave to wrap functions, but component itself is not refactored - Ineline Edit solves this
	3. Add whole_discount_value (with InlineEdit)
	4. Add whole_discount_type  - Can't do InlineEdit
	5. At least have a way to update the discount type, although UI is awful

### Thoughts

1. refactor the purchase code, so that components can be reused 
	1. added a autosave component for reuse in hook 
	But then we have multiple editing fields and if you look at the previous code, we are setting the editingId as the purchase Id, which means that for teh same purchase, whole discount and location will have the same editingID, not right -> typescript is good at this.
	2. besides having the autosave, the components (needing to differ between edit mode) is also pretty long- and can  be refactored 


When designing the component to toggle between units for the whole discount type (and also the tax tip ? and unit type for weight and count) I kind of considered more about the currency and if I should let the users define their own unit like in notion. 
GPT said to keep it simple at first, and the backend and frontend should be separated in terms of functionality, meaning that the backend could operate differently for the currency and the unit, but in the frontend, it might be similar because the UI just needs to provide the ability to swap between types and units types. 
2. Don't need to be like notion because mine is domain specific so users want it to be easy and straightforward.
3. The unit conversions can be done later so we can just first define just several for now.
