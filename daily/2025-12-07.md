So we now have the expense page and login page, what are things that we have to do next ? 
#### Come up with MVP to make it work first 
	Otherwise I wouldn't be able to do anything
	
-  User login possible 
	- What kind of authentication? 
		- Session-Based Authentication (Stateful)
		- OAuth2 Login
-  Add expense possible 
	- Do I need all of the fields defined shown ? 
		- No - Define minimum functionality and implement
- Add purchase possible 
	- Come up with purchase page in front end
	- Define several fields - do similar to expense
#### Postponed
-  Change the current frontend to using React Query with useReducer ?
	- Currently it is using useState

### TO DO 
1. Setup the user and login page
	1. Define backend, database 
	2. implement authentication (both)
2. Setup expense and purchase page
	1. Define APIs  - flexible to add other fields
	2. be able to add expense and purchase entries.
