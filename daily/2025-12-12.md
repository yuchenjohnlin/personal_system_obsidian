### TO DO
1. Purchase
	1. Add function of adding a purchase (without expense)
		1. list the location and the amount of money spent 
	2. add function of deleting a purchase (where should the button be)
	3. be able to expand the purchase, if no purchase then show add expense.
------------------------ Not Done ---------------------------
2. Expense
	1. Add add expense function 
	2. add delete function 
3. add update function for both expense and purchase
	 this would act a little like debounce and autosave


### Thoughts
Added hooks and api folder to frontend. What are these folders for ? 
`api` -  how to talk to the server ? 
`hooks` - how does React consume server data

because I am defining the types in react for typescript, I separated the original purchase type into different situations.
The  difference between using Partial<> and ? as optional when defining the type in typescript has this convention, to me it still feels the same but I understand the convention: 
When  defning create but some are optional - use ?, so you understand that some are optional for the DTO (data transfer object), it becomes explicit, readable, stable. 
when using Partial<>, it kind of creates another object? but anyways, the meaning is any subset of the creation fields can be updated. This is exactly what PATCH means so is often used.
